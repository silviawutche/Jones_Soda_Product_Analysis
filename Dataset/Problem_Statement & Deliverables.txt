Operational analytics for manufacturing optimization

Domain: Manufacturing
Function: Operations

Background:
Jones Soda, a beverage manufacturing company, is facing production inefficiencies due to frequent downtime and variations in product performance. The company seeks to reduce downtime by 50% and improve production efficiency by analyzing product-specific production trends, downtime causes, and bottlenecks.

The dataset provided captures key production details, including batch times, downtime reasons, and product characteristics such as flavor and size. 
By leveraging this data, the goal is to identify the most downtime-prone products, understand inefficiencies in batch production, and develop data-driven solutions to optimize the production line.

Task:
As a data analyst, your job is to analyze the dataset and deliver actionable insights to streamline product performance and reduce inefficiencies. The focus is on:

Product-Specific Downtime Analysis: Identify which products experience the highest downtime and the primary causes affecting production flow.
Batch Efficiency & Production Loss: Assess variations in batch times, quantify lost production hours, and determine how downtime impacts product output.
Productivity Bottlenecks: Pinpoint products that consistently experience high batch failure rates and frequent machine adjustments and recommend corrective actions.
Operational Optimization: Provide strategies to enhance efficiency by minimizing product-specific delays and machine failures.

Deliverables:
ðŸ“Œ Product Downtime Insights: Identify products with the longest downtime, their primary failure causes, and their overall impact on efficiency.
ðŸ“Œ Batch Production Performance: Compare production times across different products and highlight inefficiencies.
ðŸ“Œ Lost Production & Recovery Potential: Quantify lost batches due to downtime and project potential gains from reducing downtime by 50%.
ðŸ“Œ Optimization Strategies: Recommend product-specific improvements to reduce machine failures, streamline batch transitions, and enhance production consistency.
